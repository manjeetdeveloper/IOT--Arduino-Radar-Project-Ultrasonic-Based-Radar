Radio Detection and Ranging is the meaning of the term RADAR. Radar is an object detection system that uses microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, and speed of objects within about a 100-mile radius of their location.

## Do you know?
### How does radar work?
Radio Detection and Ranging is the meaning of the term RADAR. Radar is an object detection system that uses microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, and speed of objects within about a 100-mile radius of their location.

The radar antenna transmits radio waves or microwaves that bounce off any object in their path. Due to this, we can easily determine the object in the radar range.
A radar is an electromagnetic sensor that is used to detect and locate an object.


## list has two main components: the transmitter and the receiver. The transmitter emits the sound using a piezoelectric crystal, and the receiver encounters the sound after it has traveled to and from the target.

## The formula for this calculation is,
      # D = Â½ T x C

      # where
   
* `D = distance`: Description of command1.
 * `T = time`: Description of command1.
    * `C = speed of sound which is 343 meters/second.`: Description of command1.
